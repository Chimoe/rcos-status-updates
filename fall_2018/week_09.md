## Last Week's Accomplishments

Implemented b-table and its filtering functionality

## This Week's Plan

Right now we need:
• add a link to the Github page on the app
• use the Examples.vue component in ReferenceTag.vue so each tag can have multiple examples
• add additional code examples for each tag (2-3 total for each tag).
I will do as many as I can

## Anything Blocking?
