## Last Week's Accomplishments

Thank goodness we finally dumped Agency for good.  
As a member of the frontend team, I contacted Ziting Wang and made some arrangements.

## This Week's Plan

Decide the technology with my teammates.
I mastered JS/HTML5/Vue/CSS, and got a little bit knowledge of jQuery.
I would wait and see what they can help with the project.

## Anything Blocking?

The third member of frontend team is missing.
