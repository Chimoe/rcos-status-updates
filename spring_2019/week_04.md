## Last Week's Accomplishments

We made a call and learnt most of Kenâ€™s clients have their (Agency) systems hosted by Ken, but one client is running on their own CentOS environment.  
I also studied the relation of the tabs in the spreadsheet provided as an example from APL.
In the end of the week, I was assigned to the Frontend team.


## This Week's Plan

Try to implement the color code and import feature in the demo verison of Agency.

## Anything Blocking?

We still need our working version of agency.
