## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I finished the first demo version of one part of xls files, complete_list_updated.html.
I send it to the backend team as a reference.

## This Week's Plan

Bring color coding for the complete_list_updated.html file and teach my teammate essential skills.
Try to implement jQuery search feature.

## Anything Blocking?

Backend team is still struggling with import, we don't know what the data will be looked like.

## Notes

It's not on GitHub so I saved chat history as evidence of contribution.
