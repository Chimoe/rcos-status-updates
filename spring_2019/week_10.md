## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finished Vue for the list, waiting for commit.
Took a deep look into our database.

## This Week's Plan

Work on presentation.

## Anything Blocking?

My teammate claimed to learnt something but did not commit anything.

## Notes

The DB our backend team designed is actually good(much better than mine in CSCI 4380). However the data given by APL is a huge mess, so we cannot do anything about it. Maybe that could be the reason why Ann needs us, the Agency.
