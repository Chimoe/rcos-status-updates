## Last Week's Accomplishments

In the past week I installed PostgreSQL server and downloaded the code of Agency software on my VM. 
I also spent some time studying the code of agency and watched several PHP and SQL tutorials. 

## This Week's Plan

I plan to continue studying the code and get Agency installed on my VM.

## Anything Blocking?

Nobody knows what we'll be heading to and it seems nobody got Agency running on their local machine.
