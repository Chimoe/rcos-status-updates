## Last Week's Accomplishments

We agreed to stop focus on installing the Agency software and regrouped ourselves to learn the demands of our stakeholder.
We also took a field trip to the APL and learnt their Demands & Requests.  
I restored my VM and it's now under Debian 9 which could be used as a test server of our version of Agency.

## This Week's Plan

We will transfer our notes to the google docs and discuss it with Ken.  
Since the current version of Agency could work with APL request, I would like to start learning its code and structure.


## Anything Blocking?

We still need a installation guide for the Agency software.

## Notes

The privacy of patrons in APL is another concern of mine, because the data we will be processing is like a "crime" record.
