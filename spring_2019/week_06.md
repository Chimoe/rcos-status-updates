## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I continued to work on UI/UX layout design and discussed some basic design concept with my teammate.

## This Week's Plan

Transfer part of APL data into HTML table(s);
Write basic HTML page for Agency Frontend;
Teach my teammate some frontend technologies.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm doing 3 credits for RCOS and my teammate is doing RCOS for nothing.
And we do not have that third teammate so I may need to do everything.

## Notes
