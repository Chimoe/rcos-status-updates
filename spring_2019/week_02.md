## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I tried to install Agency on my VM. It turned out the Agency installation guide is designed for Fedora but Ken Tanzer says the guide may also work for Ubantu.  
However my installation failed and it broke other things on my VM and I have to rebuild it into a Fedora machine. The installation guide does not work for it either.

## This Week's Plan

I would like to wait for an updated collaborative installation guide by Ken Tanzer, and our group could then get the things going.  
I also needs to restore things lost on my VM and help my friends passing the Great Firewall, again.

## Anything Blocking?

Every single one of us failed during installation.
